---

## Before Cleaning – Prep for the Cleaning Crew

### 1. Access & Logistics
- [ ] Confirm cleaning date and arrival window for **Dec 4** with the company
- [ ] Share **house address**, gate/entry codes (if any), and parking instructions
- [ ] Confirm how many cleaners are coming and approximate duration
- [ ] Decide who will be **on-site** to let them in and do a walkthrough

### 2. Rooms & Priorities
- [ ] Walk each room and list your **top priorities** (kitchen, bathrooms, kids’ room, master, etc.)
- [ ] Decide if any areas are **off-limits** (e.g., certain closets, packed boxes)
- [ ] Note special requests (e.g., “focus on baseboards and window sills,” “detailed bathroom scrub,” “inside fridge if empty”)
- [ ] Communicate these clearly to the crew lead at the start

### 3. Surfaces to Clear (So They Can Actually Clean)
- [ ] Clear kitchen counters as much as possible (small appliances, mail piles)
- [ ] Tidy bathroom counters so they can scrub sinks and backsplashes
- [ ] Pick up floors (toys, laundry, shoes) so they can vacuum/mop everywhere
- [ ] Move fragile decor or valuables to a safe spot so they don’t have to handle them

### 4. Supplies & Safety
- [ ] Confirm if cleaners bring their **own supplies** or if you must provide any
- [ ] If they use your supplies, set out:
  - [ ] All-purpose cleaner, bathroom cleaner, glass cleaner
  - [ ] Mop/bucket, vacuum, broom, dustpan
  - [ ] Microfiber cloths / rags, paper towels
- [ ] Put away important documents, jewelry, cash, and sensitive items
- [ ] Crate or plan for **pets** so they don’t interfere or get stressed

### 5. Quick Pre-Clean Photos
- [ ] Take a few photos of key areas (kitchen, bathrooms, living areas) **before** cleaning
  - Useful for seeing the difference after and for any follow-up with the company
