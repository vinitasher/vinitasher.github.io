  <h1>Lady Whistledown’s Table Challenge — Practice Round</h1>
  <p class="lead">This one-page handout is printable for hosts or volunteers to run one quick practice scandal before the game starts.</p>

  <h2>Instructions (Host)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Read the practice scandal aloud.</li>
    <li>Give tables ~20–30 seconds to quietly discuss and choose card <strong>1</strong>, <strong>2</strong> or <strong>3</strong>.</li>
    <li>On “Reveal!” have tables raise their chosen card. Mark correct tables on your tally sheet.</li>
    <li>Use practice to demonstrate pacing and scoring.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Practice Scandal (Read Aloud)</h2>
  <pre>
“Dearest Readers, a most curious kerfuffle has reached my desk. During last week's garden soiree, one of the guests absconded with the host's dainty sugar tongs. Three persons were seen lingering near the tea tray:

1) Mrs. Greenwood — recently returned from the continent and always a touch too eager for sweets;
2) Mr. Pritchard — who confessed a weakness for silver at soirées;
3) Miss Lane — who was seen practicing her curtsey near the tea table earlier in the evening.

Which of these three pilfered the silver? Discuss and choose your table's vote (A, B, or C). On the count of three — reveal!”
  </pre>

  <h3>Host Tip</h3>
  <p class="note">For the practice round pick an answer (e.g., <strong>2</strong>) and mark the tally sheet to show how to score. Keep it light — the practice is to get guests comfortable with timing and the reveal.</p>
