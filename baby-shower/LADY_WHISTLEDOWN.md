# 🌸 Lady Whistledown’s Table Challenge

## Precursor: Collect a Charming, Consenting Gossip

Before the baby shower day, the host should ask each guest for a short, charmingly innocent (but slightly scandalous) anecdote about themselves — explicitly confirming they're happy for it to be shared with the room. The language below is a safe, playful template the host can use.

Host script (ask during arrival or while seating):

> "Dearest Guest, for a bit of Bridgerton mischief — would you share one short, charmingly innocent scandal about yourself that you wouldn't mind Lady Whistledown mentioning during the game? Keep it light (a funny mishap or little harmless secret), and only share something you're happy for the Ton to hear. May I record that line for the gossip rounds?"

Notes:
- Prefer short one-liners (10–20 words) so the host can read them aloud later.
- Confirm consent: if a guest hesitates, thank them and move on — never pressure anyone to share.
- The host may paraphrase for clarity and privacy (omit sensitive details) before reading it to the room.

Most Correct Votes = The Grand Prize Winners

✨ How the Game Works

Each table gets three large option cards: `A`, `B`, `C` (use numbers to identify tables for scoring).

For each scandal:

- Lady Whistledown reads the gossip + 3 suspects.
- The table discusses quietly (or dramatically!) who they believe is the true culprit.
- On “Reveal!”, the table raises its chosen number card.
- Lady Whistledown notes which tables were correct.
- At the end of all scandals, the table with the most correct guesses wins the Grand Prize.

⭐ Why This Version Is PERFECT

1. Zero chaos

    No slips. No counting dozens of votes.
    You only track tables, not people.

2. Social & fun

    Tables whisper, debate, argue, and strategize → exceptional social energy.

3. Easy scoring

    A simple tally sheet:

        Table 1: IIII

        Table 2: I

        Table 3: II

4. Dramatic suspense

    Every round builds toward the final reveal:

    “And the table crowned Most Discerning by Lady Whistledown is…”

5. Encourages teamwork

    People bond instantly when they need to agree on a choice.

6. Fits the Bridgerton vibe

    Bridgerton is all about salons, gossip circles, alliances, and competition. This captures all of that beautifully.

🎁 Prize Ideas for the Winning Table

One shared prize (fun option)

🎀 Optional: Tie-Breakers

If two tables tie, Lady Whistledown announces:

Tie-breaker options:

- One final sudden-death scandal
- Queen Charlotte’s Favor (you designate someone as “the Queen” and she selects which tied table “showed the most charm”)
- Speed guess on a bonus riddle
- Guess the baby’s due date / weight / something fun (since yours is a baby shower theme)

## Host Notes & Materials

- Large table option cards labeled `A`, `B`, `C` (sturdy cardstock or small wooden paddles); use table numbers (Table 1, Table 2...) to track scores on the tally sheet.
- Tally sheet for the host (or score sheet by table)
- Small bell or flourish sound for the reveal if desired
- Optional handout with a short example scandal to practice before the first round

Have Lady Whistledown keep the tone playful and dramatic — the point is social energy and suspense, not accuracy.

## Practice Round — Example Scandal

Read the following aloud as a short practice scandal and invite each table to discuss and choose `A`, `B`, or `C`. Use this to demonstrate timing and the reveal.

Example scandal (practice):

"Dearest Readers, a most curious kerfuffle has reached my desk. During last week's garden soiree, one of the guests absconded with the host's dainty sugar tongs. Three persons were seen lingering near the tea tray: 1) Mrs. Greenwood, recently returned from the continent and always a touch too eager for sweets; 2) Mr. Pritchard, who confessed a weakness for silver at soirées; 3) Miss Lane, who was seen practicing her curtsey near the tea table earlier in the evening. Which of these three pilfered the silver? Discuss and choose your table's vote. On the count of three — reveal!"

Host tip: After the reveal, announce the 'correct' answer (pick one for the practice round) and show how to mark the tally sheet (e.g., Table 1: I, Table 2: , Table 3: I). Keep it light — the practice round is for pacing and to show how to tally.
