# 🌸 Lady Whistledown’s Table Challenge

Most Correct Votes = The Grand Prize Winners

✨ How the Game Works

Each table gets three large cards: `1`, `2`, `3`.

For each scandal:

- Lady Whistledown reads the gossip + 3 suspects.
- The table discusses quietly (or dramatically!) who they believe is the true culprit.
- On “Reveal!”, the table raises its chosen number card.
- Lady Whistledown notes which tables were correct.
- At the end of all scandals, the table with the most correct guesses wins the Grand Prize.

⭐ Why This Version Is PERFECT

1. Zero chaos

No slips. No counting dozens of votes.
You only track tables, not people.

2. Social & fun

Tables whisper, debate, argue, and strategize → exceptional social energy.

3. Easy scoring

A simple tally sheet:

Table 1: IIII

Table 2: I

Table 3: II

4. Dramatic suspense

Every round builds toward the final reveal:

“And the table crowned Most Discerning by Lady Whistledown is…”

5. Encourages teamwork

People bond instantly when they need to agree on a choice.

6. Fits the Bridgerton vibe

Bridgerton is all about salons, gossip circles, alliances, and competition. This captures all of that beautifully.

🎁 Prize Ideas for the Winning Table

Give a single larger prize for the whole table OR one gift per person. Examples:

- Mini floral hand creams

One shared prize (fun option)

- A big box of gourmet cookies

🎀 Optional: Tie-Breakers

If two tables tie, Lady Whistledown announces:

Tie-breaker options:

- One final sudden-death scandal
- Queen Charlotte’s Favor (you designate someone as “the Queen” and she selects which tied table “showed the most charm”)
- Speed guess on a bonus riddle
- Guess the baby’s due date / weight / something fun (since yours is a baby shower theme)

## Host Notes & Materials

- Large table cards labeled `1`, `2`, `3` (sturdy cardstock or small wooden paddles)
- Tally sheet for the host (or score sheet by table)
- Small bell or flourish sound for the reveal if desired
- Optional handout with a short example scandal to practice before the first round

Have Lady Whistledown keep the tone playful and dramatic — the point is social energy and suspense, not accuracy.

## Practice Round — Example Scandal

Read the following aloud as a short practice scandal and invite each table to discuss and choose `1`, `2`, or `3`. Use this to demonstrate timing and the reveal.

Example scandal (practice):

"Dearest Readers, a most curious kerfuffle has reached my desk. During last week's garden soiree, one of the guests absconded with the host's dainty sugar tongs. Three persons were seen lingering near the tea tray: 1) Mrs. Greenwood, recently returned from the continent and always a touch too eager for sweets; 2) Mr. Pritchard, who confessed a weakness for silver at soirées; 3) Miss Lane, who was seen practicing her curtsey near the tea table earlier in the evening. Which of these three pilfered the silver? Discuss and choose your table's vote. On the count of three — reveal!"

Host tip: After the reveal, announce the 'correct' answer (pick one for the practice round) and show how to mark the tally sheet (e.g., Table 1: I, Table 2: , Table 3: I). Keep it light — the practice round is for pacing and to show how to tally.
