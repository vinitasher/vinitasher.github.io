# 🌸 Lady Whistledown’s Table Challenge

Most Correct Votes = The Grand Prize Winners

✨ How the Game Works

Each table gets three large cards: `1`, `2`, `3`.

For each scandal:

- Lady Whistledown reads the gossip + 3 suspects.
- The table discusses quietly (or dramatically!) who they believe is the true culprit.
- On “Reveal!”, the table raises its chosen number card.
- Lady Whistledown notes which tables were correct.
- At the end of all scandals, the table with the most correct guesses wins the Grand Prize.

⭐ Why This Version Is PERFECT

1. Zero chaos

No slips. No counting dozens of votes.
You only track tables, not people.

2. Social & fun

Tables whisper, debate, argue, and strategize → exceptional social energy.

3. Easy scoring

A simple tally sheet:

Table 1: IIII

Table 2: I

Table 3: II

4. Dramatic suspense

Every round builds toward the final reveal:

“And the table crowned Most Discerning by Lady Whistledown is…”

5. Encourages teamwork

People bond instantly when they need to agree on a choice.

6. Fits the Bridgerton vibe

Bridgerton is all about salons, gossip circles, alliances, and competition. This captures all of that beautifully.

🎁 Prize Ideas for the Winning Table

Give a single larger prize for the whole table OR one gift per person. Examples:

Per-person prizes

- Mini candle sets
- Pearl hair clips
- English tea tins
- Macaron box
- Fancy chocolate bars
- Mini floral hand creams

One shared prize (fun option)

- A big box of gourmet cookies
- A floral centerpiece
- A tea-time basket
- A Bridgerton-themed gift box

🎀 Optional: Tie-Breakers

If two tables tie, Lady Whistledown announces:

Tie-breaker options:

- One final sudden-death scandal
- Queen Charlotte’s Favor (you designate someone as “the Queen” and she selects which tied table “showed the most charm”)
- Speed guess on a bonus riddle
- Guess the baby’s due date / weight / something fun (since yours is a baby shower theme)

## Host Notes & Materials

- Large table cards labeled `1`, `2`, `3` (sturdy cardstock or small wooden paddles)
- Tally sheet for the host (or score sheet by table)
- Small bell or flourish sound for the reveal if desired
- Optional handout with a short example scandal to practice before the first round

Have Lady Whistledown keep the tone playful and dramatic — the point is social energy and suspense, not accuracy.
