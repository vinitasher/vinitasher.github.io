# Kids Games & Activities

These activities are intended for younger guests. Run them as a supervised kids' table or as short stations during the event. Keep the kids area close to the main activity space and provide adult supervision.

## Activities

- **Guess the Bottle (Color/Contents)**
  - Kid-safe setup: use non-breakable, low-height bottles or plastic cups with colored water or juice.
  - Number each bottle and provide simple answer sheets where children can select a color or match pictures rather than write detailed guesses.
  - Provide small prizes (stickers, small toys) for participation and winners.

- **Paint the Bib**
  - Supplies: plain bibs, fabric markers or non-toxic fabric paints, brushes, water cups, aprons, table covers, and wet-wipes.
  - Offer stencils (hearts, flowers, letters) for younger children and a drying area to store finished bibs.

- **Paint a Block**
  - Supplies: sanded wooden blocks, non-toxic paints/markers, brushes, table protection, small drying rack.
  - Supervise paint usage and small decorations (avoid tiny beads/glue for very young children).
