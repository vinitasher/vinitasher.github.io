# Bridgerton Attire & Ramp Walk

This page lists suggested Bridgerton-inspired wearable props and a short host script / flow for the Ramp Walk activity.

## Attire & Props (suggested)

- **Bridgerton hats with lace** — small formal hats or fascinators trimmed with lace and ribbon. Provide hat pins or clips for quick attachment.
- **Gloves with lace** — short or elbow-length gloves in lace or satin (white/ivory/pastel). Have spare pairs for guests who forgot theirs.
- **Pearl necklaces** — single- or double-strand faux pearl necklaces for quick glam.
- **Garlands / Flower crown** — small floral crowns or garlands in pastel tones (silk or faux flowers are easiest to manage).
- **Vintage-style folding lace hand fan** — tasteful, decorative folding fans (helpful for photos and the Bridgerton vibe).
- **Tea-time stickers** — small themed stickers (teacups, roses, tiny crowns) as giveaways or for kids' crafts and name tags.

## Ramp Walk Flow (short script & logistics)

1. Setup
   - Place a short runway area (2–4m) with a backdrop and clear photo spot at the end.
   - Arrange props on a dressing table near the runway: hats, pearls, gloves, fans, and crowns.
   - Have a volunteer or host to help guests put on props and supervise kids.

2. Order and timing
   - Run the Ramp Walk around **12:00 – 12:30 PM** (or as scheduled in the main timeline).
   - Invite participating guests (primarily the ladies) to line up at the dressing table.

3. Host Script (example)
   - "Ladies (and gentle readers), please make your way to the dressing table to receive your Bridgerton accoutrements. When you're ready, we'll present you to the Ton."  
   - As each guest walks the ramp: announce their name and a short, playful line (e.g., "Presenting Mrs. Patel, most agreeable in periwinkle").
   - Encourage poses at the photo spot; keep music light and instrumental.

4. Music & pacing
   - Use a short playlist of Bridgerton-style instrumentals (30–60 seconds per participant) so the flow stays brisk.

5. Photos & wrap-up
   - End with a group photo at the backdrop with the parents-to-be.
   - Thank participants and direct them to the seating/tea area.

## Notes & Safety

- Keep small parts (pins, clips) supervised and provide safety pins rather than exposed sharp pins when possible.
- For hats and crowns, make quick-adjust options (elastic or clips) for different head sizes.
- If children participate, ensure adult supervision while dressing and walking the ramp.
